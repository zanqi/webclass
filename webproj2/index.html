            <h2>Ingredients You'll Need</h2>
            <img src="images/ingredients.jpg" alt="Ingredients on a table" class="width-100">

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Chicken –&nbsp;</strong>Bite-sized pieces of skinless, boneless chicken for convenience and
                    ease of consumption.</li>
                <li><strong>Olive Oil –&nbsp;</strong>Opt for the rich flavor of olive oil to saute our ingredients,
                    although
                    a lighter alternative like canola oil can also be used.</li>
                <li><strong>Spices –&nbsp;</strong>A touch of curry powder is all that's required to enhance the
                    delectable flavors of this
                    dish.</li>
                <li><strong>Garlic –&nbsp;</strong>Adjust the amount of garlic to your preference, whether you prefer
                    a subtle or robust
                    garlic taste.</li>
                <li><strong>Onion –&nbsp;</strong>Finely chopped onion ready to be sauteed until it reaches a
                    perfect translucent state.</li>
                <li><strong>Tomatoes –&nbsp;</strong>Incorporate a can of diced tomatoes and some tomato paste to
                    infuse the dish with a
                    delightful acidity. Fire-roasted tomatoes can be used for an extra burst of flavor, if available.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Coconut milk –&nbsp;</strong>A single can of coconut milk is all it takes to achieve a
                    lusciously creamy and
                    coconut-infused curry.</li>
                <li><strong>Sugar –&nbsp;</strong>Add a hint of sweetness to balance the savory and acidic flavors.
                    Granulated white sugar
                    works well in this recipe.</li>
                <li><strong>Chicken broth –&nbsp;</strong>Opt for low-sodium chicken broth to control the overall sodium
                    content of the curry.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Seasoning –&nbsp;</strong>Adjust the salt and pepper to taste, allowing you to fine-tune the
                    seasoning according
                    to your preferences.</li>
            </ul>

            <ol>
                <li><strong><strong>Prepare the chicken:</strong></strong> In a spacious skillet or Dutch oven, heat up
                    the olive oil. Introduce the chicken to the Dutch oven and season it with salt and pepper. Cook for
                    approximately 5 minutes or until the chicken is no longer pink.</li>
                <li><strong>Complete the dish:</strong> Add the onion, garlic, and curry powder, then stir everything
                    together. Continue cooking for an additional 2 minutes before including the chicken broth, coconut
                    milk, tomatoes, tomato paste, and sugar. Thoroughly combine all the ingredients, bring the mixture
                    to a boil, and cover with a lid. Reduce the heat and let it simmer for another 15 to 20 minutes.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Enhance and serve:</strong> Sprinkle some parsley as a garnish and serve the dish over a bed
                    of rice..</li>

            <ul>
                <li>Feel free to select your preferred rice variety. Personally, I enjoy preparing a serving of light
                    and fluffy jasmine rice, which serves as an excellent foundation for savoring this delightful
                    mixture. Alternatively, you can opt for the aromatic and creamy goodness of coconut rice to enhance
                    the flavors of this delicious combination.</li>
                <li>Naan bread</li>
                <li>For a traditional British classic, elevate your culinary experience by generously pouring this curry
                    over a bed of crispy french fries.</li>
                <li>With zucchini noodles</li>
