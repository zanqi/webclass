    Hi everyone, my name is Zanqi. The pronunciation from google translate is pretty accurate <a

    <dt>What is my goal? Why am I taking this course? How does knowing how to code a website fit with my career goals?

        <p>
            My goals for this course are to learn more about web development and to be able to build a UI for a
            chatbotðŸ¤–. When working on the chatbot project, I found myself knowing little about web front-end
            development. I hope to learn more about it in this course and be able to build a rudimentary UI. I am quite
            passionate about AI and NLP. Please feel free to reach out to me if you are interested in these topics as
            well.
        </p>
        <p>
            I would also love to create a <strong>personal blog</strong>. I want to put some learning notes about AI there and share my
            thoughts. I want to have some control on the styles and learn how to deploy it, so maybe not a wordpress
            blog. If you have some pointers, please let me know.
        </p>
        <p>
            As you can see, knowing how to code a website definitely helps me to achieve my goals. I am looking forward
            to
            learning from you all.

    <dt>My experiences with web page development and/or HTML & CSS</dt>
    <dd>
        <p>
            Very little hands-on experience. I have followed some tutorial on javascript UI framework before, but not
            experienced enough to build a modern webpage.

    <dt>Best advice for success in online course</dt>
    <dd>
        <p>
            For a coding course, I think being hands-on on the exercise will be important. Try code out what you've
            learned
            in small pieces.
